\class Segment_BiLinearQuad

\brief <b> A class to define a 4-noded quadrilateral 2D Segment</b>

This class defines a 4-noded linear 2D quadrilateral interface surface segment.

<b>Important:</b><br>
Upon construction, the user must assure that the nodes attached to this segment are
given in counter-clockwise order such that the outward normal to the domain
points out from the screen:<br>
<pre>
        Node 3     Node 2
          o----------o
          |          |
          |          |           
          |          |                   <-------| 
          |          |            domain surface | 
          o----------o                      ------  
        Node 0     Node 1

</pre>
The reason for this is that the outward normal to the interface is implicitly defined by
the orientation of the segments. There is no way for the MOERTEL package to check the
orientation of the segments as they are passed in by the user and most obscure results
will be produced when the orientation is uncorrect!

<b>Important:</b><br>
There is currently no full support for quadrilateral interface discretizations. However,
when quads are added to a \ref MOERTEL::Interface they will be split into
2 triangles internally that are then used to perform the integration. The orientation of
the 2 triangles resulting from 1 quad is consistent with the orientation of the quad.

The \ref MOERTEL::Segment_BiLinearQuad class supports the ostream& operator <<
