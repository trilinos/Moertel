\section Moertel_intro Introduction
Moertel provides fundamental construction
routines and services that are required for serial and
parallel mesh-tying and contact formulations using Mortar methods.  

\section Moertel_overview Overview of Moertel.

\subsection Capabilities Capabilities

This package supplies capabilities for nonconforming mesh tying and contact
formulations in  2 and 3 dimensions using Mortar methods. 
Mortar methods are a type of Lagrange Multiplier constraints that can be used
in contact formulations and in non-conforming or conforming mesh tying as
well as in domain decomposition techniques.
Originally introduced as a domain decomposition method for spectral elements,
Mortar methods are used in a large class of nonconforming situations such as
the surface coupling of different physical models, discretization schemes or
non-matching triangulations along interior interfaces of a domain.<br>
<br>
Suitable conditions at interfaces are formulated as weak continuity conditions
in dual variables introducing Lagrange multipliers on the interface.
By an approbiate choice of the function space of the Lagrange multipliers on
an interface it is possible to locally condense Lagrange multipliers such that an
sparse and definite system of equations can be formed which is equivalent to 
the saddle point system resulting from the Lagrange multiplier formulation.<br>
Moreover if the problems on subdomains are symmetric positive definite (spd) or 
symmetric positive indefinite and the complete problem is known to be spd, then
a spd system of equations can be recovered that leads to the same solution as the
saddle point system of equations. This way, unmodfied standard solution techniques
such as multigrid can be applied and the reduction in the solution costs can be
expected to compensate costs for the Mortar formulation of the problem.<br>
<br>
This package currently has the following capabilities and features:
<ul> 

<li> Construction of one or several non-conforming interfaces in 2D/3D, where each side
     of an interface is discretized with low order finite elements.

<li> Handling of 'corner nodes' and 'edge nodes' in the case of several 
     interfaces sharing common nodes.

<li> Construction of a discrete Lagrange multiplier space on interfaces, were
     the space is determined by the choice of the user and the trace spaces of
     the underlying finite element functions on the interfaces.

<li> Construction of corresponding coupling matrices and construction of a
     saddle point system of equations if the user provides the stiffness matrices
     of the subdomains. 

<li> Construction of an equivalent sparse symmetric or unsymmetric definite
     system of equations if the user provides the stiffness matrices of the
     subdomains and depending on the user's choice of the Lagrange multiplier space. 

<li> Full support interfaces to Trilinos packages Amesos (direct solvers), 
     AztecOO (preconditioned iterative methods) and ML (algebraic multigrid preconditioners)
     for the solution of resulting systems of equations.<br>
     The user for example might supply subdomain stiffness matrices, left and right hand
     side vectors, choose solver options, define interfaces among subdomains 
     and then use the Moertel package and its solver interfaces obtain the solution of the tied problem.
     
<li> Access to internal data to let the user build his/her own contact formulation or
     domain decomposition method based on Mortar formulations without the neccessity 
     to actually implement core Mortar functionality. 

<li> Easy extensibility due to a modular and object orientated implementation. 

<li> Support for parallel and serial applications, where in the parallel case
     the interfaces are not expected to meet any partitioning requirements among
     processors, as most application will focuse on the partitioning of subdomains
     and not on interfaces. Partitioning of one or more interfaces is completely
     arbitrary.

<li> 'Grey box' mesh tying for low order finite element discretizations
</ul>
This package does not feature:
<ul> 
<li> Black box contact formulations though it provides substantial building blocks
     for the construction of such methods.

<li> black box domain decomposition techniques such as Dirichlet-Neumann or
     Dirichlet-Dirichlet (and derived) coupling algorithms.<br>
     It though provides substantial building blocks for the construction of such algorithms.
</ul>
     
\subsection Configuration Configuration

The Moertel package severly depends on the other Trilinos packages Epetra,
EpetraExt, Teuchos, Amesos, AztecOO and ML.<br>
<br>
To use Moertel one has to use at least the following enabled when 
configuring Trilinos:
\code
--enable-moertel 
--enable-epetra 
--enable-epetraext
--enable-teuchos 
--enable-ml
--enable-aztecoo --enable-aztecoo-teuchos 
--enable-amesos
\endcode 

\subsection User_interface User interface

Described here is what would be the typical usage of Moertel for a mesh tying problem.<br>
<br>
One would typically first construct an empty MOERTEL::Interface instance. This
is a collective operation as all processors have to at least know about
all existing interfaces.<br>
Any MOERTEL::Interface instance has 2 sides which can be constructed 
independently and nonconforming.<br> 
Then it is neccessary to supply information about
the geometry and connectivity of that Interface. This is done by defining
an arbitrary number of MOERTEL::Node and MOERTEL::Segment instances 
and adding them to either side of the Interface.
\note
To be more precise: The user has to define instances of one of the supplied
MOERTEL::Segment derived types as MOERTEL::Segment itself is virtual. Currently, 
the package supports linear 1D segments in 2D problems, bilinear quadrilateral
segments in 3D problems and linear triangle segments in 3D problems. 
<br>
\note
Adding a MOERTEL::Node or MOERTEL::Segment to a MOERTEL::Interface is NOT
a collective operation. Nodes and Segments are added by individual processes which
then become owner of that Node or Segment on that specific interface.<br>
Every process that does NOT add any Node or Segment instances to an interface 
will not take part in any computations performed on that Interface instance 
though some of the methods are collective for all procs.
Most Interface methods will be non-blocking for such processes.

After adding all segments and nodes to the Interface that are neccessary to define
both sides of it the user has to indicate the completeness of the
interface instance by calling MOERTEL::Interface::Complete() on it.


The base class for the user interface is the \ref MOERTEL::Manager.<br>
It supplies all methods neccessary to perform the Mortar integration and to 
solve resulting systems of equations.
